# Marlin Firmware for **OctoEnder**
This repository is where I maintain my **OctoEnder**. What is **OctoEnder**? It is 3D printer **Ender-3 PRO** on steroids ;) It is inspired by superior article [OctoEnder alias super-silent printer](https://www.3dpedie.cz/en/inspirations/octoender_by_kiron) and some Reddit Guides. All credits are included in separated commits.

* Based on the most current version of Marlin (`bugfix-2.0.x`)
* Changes are always on top of repository
* [Configuration files](https://github.com/diy4fun/marlin-configurations) as symlinks to cloned repo in parent dir
* Included helper `./sync` for easy sync with upstream
